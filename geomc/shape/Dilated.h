/* todo: intersect(ray) could work like this: intersect the dilated box first. if miss,
 * done. the actual hit, if it exists, is inside the interval where the ray overlaps
 * the box. if the ray hits the un-dilated object, this further constrains
 * where the hit could be. then root-find in the interval using sdf().
 *
 * in fact, could use project() instead of sdf() to root-find the ray hit--
 * project() gives you a plane in front of which no shape points are closer.
 * you know immediately that any hit points are behind that plane; which gives
 * you an interval. if at any moment the intersecton of such an interval with any
 * other interval (box interval; another plane interval) is empty, then ray misses.
 * could iteravely project the estimated ray entry/exit points until some kind of
 * convergence.
 *
 * could try to interpolate the hit pointâ€” get a point on the inside/outside
 * and interpolate hit `s` value? (would second-order interp help...?)
 *
 * termination conditions:
 * - ds / s?
 * - |surf pt - ray pt|?
 * - ray.v dot n?
 * - |dn|?
 * > want it to work robustly for planar sufraces (i.e. not iterate)
 * 
 *  - another thought was to move the ray origin in the direction toward the surface,
 *    but really you need to move the ray in the direction from the ray axis to the shape.
 *    that's probably not feasible to do without searching, given the methods available.
 *  - second issue is that this wouldn't thicken the shape as we expect.
