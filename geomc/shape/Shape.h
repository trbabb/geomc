// todo: other concepts:
// - separate contains(pt) from sdf? ("Closed?")
// - could make RayIntersectable<...> into Intersectable<OtherShape>
//   - note that the return type for Ray is special, and might be for other shapes too
// todo: add a unified translation op that can work on most shapes
//   (natural for all but Frustum)

// todo: other compositional shapes?
// x Intersected<Shape1, Shape2>
//   - ray intersection is the intersection of ray intervals (RayIntersectable)
//   x convex_support is the point with lower dot with `d` (Convex)?
//      > nope, that's wrong
//      > if that were true, then you could trivially construct an intersection
//        shape and then check if its bbox is empty, instead of gjk
//      > imagine with two intersecting spheresâ€” you get surface points
//        on a non-convex shape.
//   x sdf is max(sdf(a), sdf(b)) (SdfEvaluable)?
//      > nope, that's a bound, not a true sdf
//   x project() is the more inward of the two projection points (Projectable)?
//      > also wrong. consider two overlapping spheres; a lenticular shape.
//        many points should project to the ridge; that ridge point is usually
//        not the projection point on either of the two shapes.
//      > haven't proven this route impossible, though. something magic
//        might be possible by a combination of project() and support()
//        (but quite unlikely as it would be novel).
//      - you want: douglas-rachford algorithm
//        - https://x.com/gabrielpeyre/status/1791332821459472643
//   - some shapes are closed under intersection (Rect)
// - minkowski sum
//   - ray intersection is interval minkowski sum (implemented)
//   - convex_support() is the sum of the two pts
//   x I think project() is b.project(p - a.project(p)) + a.project(p)
//     x this is incorrect
//     > consider any shape which isn't centered on the projected point
//     > this is a very general inversion problem: find a point on the shape
//       at which to center the added shape, such that p's projection distance
//       is minimal. there is no general way to know, without searching, which of
//       all possible points in the shape that is.
//     > if this were true it would again suggest a trivial alternative to gjk
//       (check minkowski_shape.contains(origin))
